# Trader-behaviour-insights-based-on-Market-Sentiment
Data-driven analysis of crypto trader behaviour using sentiment data (Fear & Greed Index).


This project explores how crypto traders behave under different market sentiments — such as Fear, Greed, Extreme Fear, and Extreme Greed — using two datasets: historical trading data and the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index. The goal is to uncover how emotions influence trading performance, direction, and decision-making patterns.

## Project Structure

- `historical_data.csv` – Contains over 200,000 real trades from a crypto platform, including execution time, side (BUY/SELL), trade size, and PnL.
- `fear_greed_index.csv` – Contains daily sentiment labels (Fear, Greed, etc.) and dates.
- `trader_sentiment_analysis.ipynb` – Python notebook with full data cleaning, merging, analysis, and visualizations.
- `Visual_Report.pdf` – Canva-designed project summary with key plots and observations.

## Objectives

- Understand how market sentiment impacts trader behavior
- Measure average profit/loss across different emotions
- Compare trade sizes and risk-taking patterns under emotional conditions
- Visualize BUY vs SELL activity per sentiment label
- Recommend smarter strategies using data-driven insights

## Tools Used

- **Python**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Canva**: For visual storytelling and final presentation
- **GitHub**: Version control and project sharing

---

## Key Insights

- Highest profits occurred during **Extreme Greed**, suggesting traders capitalized on bullish momentum.
- Surprisingly, **Fear** had the largest average trade size — possibly due to opportunistic risk-taking.
- Traders bought more during **Greed** and sold more during **Fear**, confirming emotional bias in trade direction.
- Smart strategies like **sentiment-aware alerts** and **emotional risk control** can help improve decision-making.

## What I Learned

- Real-world sentiment data can reveal valuable behavioral patterns in financial decision-making.
- Data visualization is key to uncovering trends that aren't obvious from raw tables.
- Crypto markets are emotionally volatile — and data can help tame that uncertainty.
